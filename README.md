# Data Visualization for Pymaceuticals, INC

This code is analyzing pharmaceutical data with mice. It's using pandas and jupyter notebook and combines data from two csv file to create one big set of data. The code figures out the average weight of the mice and the average size of their tumors, followed by multiple plots to to show these numbers. 

# Analysis
249 mice conducted by Pymaceuticals revealed some insights. The sex distribution of the mice were rougly equal, with 50% being male and 50% being female. Additionally, 9 different drug regimens were tested, including a placebo. Out of all these drug regimens, Ramicane appeared to be the most effective at reducing tumor growth, as it had the lowest mean, median, variance, and standard deviation among the tested drugs. Capomulin was also effective, and both drugs had the highest number of timepoints. The correlation and regression analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between tumor volume and mouse weight, with a correlation of 0.84. Overall, Ramicane and Capmulin were found to be the most effective drugs in reducing tumor growth among the tested regimens.
